<b>Daniel Silva, <i>Prince of Fire</i></b><br>

I thoroughly enjoyed Silva's first few books, but with the Gabriel Allon series, he's really honed his skills. Allon is the epitome of the "reluctant spy," the unwilling right hand of master tactician Ari Shamron, a fascinating character in turn, whose iron grip on the "Office" (the Israeli Mossad) may falter on occasion, but never slips entirely. In <i>Prince of Fire</i>, Allon's cover is blown after the Israeli embassy is bombed in Rome, and he's forced back into the strictures of government service, where he begins tracking down the man responsible for the attack. Soon, however, it becomes apparent that the man behind the bombing has connections that go straight to the top of the Palestinian leadership, and as Allon draws closer to his target, he uncovers some dangerous truths about his own past. It all leads up to an insurmountable climax, played out by some of the most compelling characters in modern fiction. Silva truly deserves the comparisons that have been made between his work and that of le Carré and Graham Greene.

<b>John Connolly, <i>The Black Angel</i></b><br>

Connolly, an Irish journalist/writer who's had huge success in the U.K., is destined to break out here in the U.S. Nobody can blend a multitude of elements quite like Connolly, and while his books are inevitably described as "thrillers," the truth is that his work cannot be summed up so easily. In <i>The Black Angel</i>, series hero Charlie "Bird" Parker is asked to aid in the search for a young prostitute who's disappeared on the streets of New York City. Through a uniquely-drawn plot, Parker's search takes him into the dark and disturbing world of the Black Angel, an object thought by many to be evil incarnate - but also a myth. However, Parker soon discovers that the Black Angel is real, and far more terrifying than the legend lets on.<br><br> 

Connolly frequently refers to the "honeycomb world," the dark, hidden side of everyday life, an idea that's neatly woven into his latest novel. On a lighter note, Connolly has a great sense of humor; listen to his interviews with Bill Thompson at <a href="http://www.eyeonbooks.com" target="blank">www.eyeonbooks.com</a>.

<b>Brad Thor, <i>Blowback</i></b><br>

Brad is the <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author of six novels and a dominant force on the international thriller scene. <i>Blowback</i> isn't quite his latest - <i>Takedown</i> is scheduled for release in June - but the story could not be more current. <i>Blowback</i> begins with the murder of a prominent archaeologist and the discovery of a lethal contagion in Asalaam, a small village in Northern Iraq. From there, the action only escalates as Thor brings former Secret Service agent and Navy Seal Scot Harvath into the fold. Harvath is an extremely likable hero, reminiscent of DeMille's best: tough, fearless, and equipped with a healthy dose of wry humor. Moreover, he takes his lumps as often as he dishes them out, which separates him from the rising number of series heroes who appear to be virtually immune from harm. <br><br>

Added to the mix is Jillian Alcott, a British paleopathologist and Harvath's only link to the scientist who developed the contagion. Alcott, in particular, is a well-developed, very capable character whose contributions to the plot go far beyond her physical beauty. It's the template for a fascinating, all-too plausible novel, and Thor delivers with the confidence of a seasoned pro.

<b>George Dawes Green, <i>The Juror</i></b><br>

If you've seen the movie, don't be put off; the book is infinitely better. Annie Laird is a struggling young mother whose life is wrapped up in her interminable day job, her passion for sculpture, and her 12-year-old son, Oliver. When she unexpectedly sells some of her work at the local gallery for a huge sum, she believes her life is finally on track - until she learns that the sale was orchestrated by the "Teacher," Green's astoundingly well-written villain, and is inextricably linked to her latest role, that of juror 224 at the trial of Louie Boffano. To save her own life, the life of her friend Juliet, and the life of her son, she only has to say two words: not guilty.<br><br>

Nobody ratchets up the suspense quite like Green, and anybody who can write a novel in present-tense - let alone a novel of this quality - deserves a modicum of praise. His dialogue is oddly compelling - you can't help but follow Annie and Juliet's playful banter with a smile - and the former is a refreshing heroine, a woman with incredible reserves of strength and ingenuity. If you haven't read this book, you're missing out.<br><br>
