<!--Andrew Britton was born in Peterborough, England, in 1981. He spent his formative years in England and Camlough, Northern Ireland, a small village which is home to most of the family on his mother's side. In 1988, his family immigrated to the United States, taking up residence in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Just before his junior year of high school, Britton moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, where he currently resides.<br><br>

Britton graduated from Leesville Road High School in 1999 and immediately joined the U.S. Army. He served as a combat engineer for three years. During that time, he was assigned to the 1st Engineer Battalion at Fort Riley, Kansas. In the summer of 2001, he received orders for Korea, where he served with the 2ID, the famed 2nd Infantry Division. He was honorably discharged as a specialist in 2002.<br><br>


Less than two months after separating from the armed forces, Britton began taking classes at Wake Technical Community College, transferring to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the fall of 2004. As an undergraduate at UNC, Britton studied economics and psychology. His education has been on hiatus for the past year, though he intends to return to school in the fall of 2006. <br><br>

Apart from writing, Britton enjoys reading, traveling, and the occasional beer at the local bar. He is currently working on the sequel to The American.
