With intricate plotting and spine tingling action, <em> The Exile</em> propels us deep into the heart of a terrifying conspiracy rooted in one  of the world&rsquo;s most unstable regions&mdash;a place where the political has  become brutally personal...<br />
<br />
For  the President of the United States, the daily horror of life in West  Darfur, Sudan&rsquo;s anarchic killing fields, just hit heartbreakingly close  to home. His beloved niece Lily, a nurse caring for refugees in the  most war-torn region, has been targeted and savagely murdered by a  corps of Janjaweed, fearsome government-backed militiamen. <br />
<br />
The rash and  vicious killing is a clear provocation, but any response will seriously  destabilize the already-teetering region and threaten the security of  the entire world. With the situation too explosive for diplomatic or  military solutions, yet with the President and the public thirsting for  revenge, America is out of options. Except one: Ryan Kealey. <br />
<br />
Kealey,  ex-Special Forces, former CIA, unrivaled counterterrorism expert, has  been central to the war on terror for over a decade. But he&rsquo;s finished  trying to save the world. After the Agency hung him out to dry&mdash;and let  his lover die&mdash;it was easy for him to turn his back. They had nothing he  wanted. Until now. For the government has revealed its trump card, the  one thing Kealey will risk everything for. <br />
<br />
Once back in  the fold, Kealey&rsquo;s pursuit of Lily&rsquo;s killers unearths secrets and  betrayals that shock even his war-tempered sensibilities and leave him  with no-one to trust. On the lawless streets of Sudan, and at the  highest levels of the American government, shadowy forces ignite a  conflagration with unknowable global consequences. <br />
<br />
Brimming with intrigue and danger, <em> The Exile</em> pulses with high-stakes gamble after gamble, as one man navigates a  tenuous web of international relations that could collapse at any  moment&hellip;
